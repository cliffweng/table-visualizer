# Check All

Run all checks to verify the project is in good shape.

## Instructions

Run linting and build sequentially:

1. First, run linting:

```bash
npm run lint
```

2. If linting passes, run the production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

3. Report the results of both checks. If any issues are found, provide a summary.
